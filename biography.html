    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am an Associate Professor of the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College. Dartmouth College is one of the Ivy League schools in America. It was found in 1769, and it is one of the best universities in nations. Before joining Dartmouth College, I was a senior research director of Kuaishou Technology, China (2020-2023) and an adjunct Professor (2017-2023) of the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I was a research director (T14) of Tencent, China (2017 - 2020), a principal research scientist of SenseTime (2015 - 2016), and an associate professor of School of Electrical Engineering at the Korea
        Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) (2009 - 2015). I received
        my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the National University of
        Singapore (NUS) in 2009. From Sept 2007 to June 2008, I worked as a
        full-time student internship in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). I
        received the M.Phil and B.Eng (First Class Honors) degrees in Computer Science
        from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2005 and
        2003 respectively. I am an Associate Editor of IEEE TPAMI (IF: 24.314) and I regularly serve as an Area Chair/Senior Program Committee in major CV/ML conferences including CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/NeurIPS/AAAI/IJCAI. I am a senior member of the IEEE.<br>
        <br>
        My major research interests are in the broad areas of <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>Multi-modalities Generative AI</strong>, including low-level vision, image/video editing, segmentation, 3D reconstruction, human pose estimation and video analysis. I am also recently interested in AIGC, multimodalities, large generative pre-trained models and their applications.</p>
